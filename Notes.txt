Backend - Java Springboot with Websocket and STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol)
Frontend - ReactJS

How the application works:
- STOMP is an envelope for the payload to communicate between the client and the server through websockets.
- STOMP is the messaging protocol that is used to communicate between the client and the server.
- STOMP adds a header to the message payload to identify the destination of the message.

- SockJS gives a coherent cross-platform (browser) JavaScript API that creates a low latency, full duplex, cross-domain communication channel
  between the browser and the web server, with WebSockets or without.
